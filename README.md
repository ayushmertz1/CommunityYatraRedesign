# Community Yatra — Website

Community-rooted travel across Nepal. Homestays, farming, craft and culture — journeys where every
rupee stays in the village that welcomes you.

This is the redesigned Community Yatra website: a fast, accessible, editorial single-page
application built for static hosting (cPanel/Apache).

## Design language

**"Warm Editorial"** — print-inspired layouts with Nepali earth tones.

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paper `#FAF6EE` | warm cream | page background |
| Ink `#221D15` | warm near-black | text |
| Clay `#B04A24` | sindoor terracotta | primary actions, accents |
| Marigold `#E2A13C` | garland gold | highlights, underlines |
| Pine `#16302A` | Himalayan forest | dark sections, footer |

- **Type**: Fraunces (variable, display) · Inter (body) · Noto Serif Devanagari (यात्रा brand accent)
- **Motion**: GSAP + ScrollTrigger reveals, Lenis smooth scroll, page-transition veil.
  All motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Texture**: SVG grain overlay, hand-drawn marigold underlines, polaroid figures.

## Stack

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) + [React 19](https://react.dev) + TypeScript (strict)
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) with design tokens in `src/styles/global.css`
- [GSAP](https://gsap.com) + [Lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering) for motion
- React Router 7 (SPA routing)
- Self-hosted fonts via Fontsource (no external requests)

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # local dev server
npm run build      # type-check + production build to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
```

## Deploy

**GitHub Pages (staging):** pushed commits auto-deploy via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`
to `https://ayushmertz1.github.io/CommunityYatraRedesign/`. The workflow builds with
`VITE_BASE=/CommunityYatraRedesign/` and copies `index.html` → `404.html` for SPA routing.

**cPanel (production):**

1. `npm run build` (no `VITE_BASE` — the site lives at the domain root)
2. Upload the **contents** of `dist/` to `public_html/` (or the domain's document root).
3. The included `.htaccess` handles SPA routing (all paths fall through to `index.html`),
   long-lived caching for hashed assets, and gzip.

**Contact form:** submissions go through [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) to the site inbox —
no server required on either host.

## Structure

```

```

## Accessibility

Skip link, semantic landmarks, visible focus rings, `lang="ne"` on Devanagari text, alt text on
meaningful imagery, keyboard-reachable interactions, WCAG AA contrast on both light and dark
sections, and full `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
